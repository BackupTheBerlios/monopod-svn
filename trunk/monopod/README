Monopod 
=======

15 June 1005, Edd Dumbill <edd@gnome.org>

Monopod is a simple Podcast client.

It's for people who want to select a few channels, come back later, and
find the the Podcast MP3s turn up on the hard disk.  People like me.

The user interface will get better in the future, but for now it's based
on an icon in the system notification area.  Right-click it, select
"Subscriptions", and off you go.

Downloaded files will turn up in the "Monopod" directory in your home
directory.  There's a directory per channel, and an M3U file in there
with a playlist for each channel.

** THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE.  EXPECT PROBLEMS **

Please see the TODO file for the development plan for Monopod and before
sending me mail asking for a new feature.  An important goal for me is
simplicity, so I won't be implementing anything that makes things
confusing.

Given how much spare time I have, it would be amazing if I implemented
much at all!

Keep an eye on my blog at http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog for news about
further releases.


Requirements
============

Mono 1.1.6 or better. Gtk#, Gnome# and Glade# 1.9.5 or better. 
You also need SQLite installed.

If you run Ubuntu 5.04 (hoary), you can get these from
backports.ubuntuforums.org.


Known bugs
==========

SQLite in Mono can't marshal UTF-8 properly.  Therefore subscribing
to non-Latin channels won't work.  Sorry.  I'm working to get this
fixed.

Misc
====

Entagged-sharp is shipped wholesale.  To freshen it, run
svn export svn://svn.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/entagged-sharp
